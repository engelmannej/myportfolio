		<p class="aboutme">Hello! My name is Ezra Engelmann and I am currently a sophmore at Mountain Vista Highschool. I have diversity in my hobbies and interests; they have become some of my targeted acheivements I want to acheieve in life. Piano and studying Quantum Mechanics have become my favorite, if not my ultimate goal. I really enjoy playing piano and the mellfluous melodies that come from the arpeggios. Additionally, Quantume Mechanics challenges my way of thinking and viewing the universe in a different perspective.
